SentimentScout Chatbot
======================

SentimentScout is a simple chatbot designed for engaging conversations. The chatbot is built using Python, TensorFlow, and NLTK, with a focus on natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

Project Overview
----------------

The project consists of the following components:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    *   Utilizes NLTK for tokenization and stemming.
    *   Processes intents from the `intents.json` file to create training and output data.
    *   Saves preprocessed data using pickle for efficient reuse.
2.  **Neural Network Model:**
    
    *   Implements a neural network using TensorFlow and TFlearn.
    *   Defines layers for input, hidden layers, and output with softmax activation.
    *   Trains the model on the preprocessed data with specified epochs and batch size.
3.  **Chatbot Interface:**
    
    *   Implements a simple chat interface where users can input messages.
    *   Utilizes the trained model to predict intent tags and generate appropriate responses.
