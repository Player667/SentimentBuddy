SentimentScout Chatbot
SentimentScout is a simple chatbot designed for engaging conversations. The chatbot is built using Python, TensorFlow, and NLTK, with a focus on natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:

Data Preprocessing:

Utilizes NLTK for tokenization and stemming.
Processes intents from the intents.json file to create training and output data.
Saves preprocessed data using pickle for efficient reuse.
Neural Network Model:

Implements a neural network using TensorFlow and TFlearn.
Defines layers for input, hidden layers, and output with softmax activation.
Trains the model on the preprocessed data with specified epochs and batch size.
Chatbot Interface:

Implements a simple chat interface where users can input messages.
Utilizes the trained model to predict intent tags and generate appropriate responses.

To use the SentimentScout chatbot:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install required dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install nltk tensorflow tflearn
Run the chat() function in the provided Python script.
bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Start chatting with SentimentScout! Type "Quit" to exit.
Contribution Guidelines
Feel free to contribute to the project by:
